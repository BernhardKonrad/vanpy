# vanpy

The [Vancouver Python User Group](http://www.meetup.com/vanpyz/) is a
volunteer-run community of Python users based in Vancouver, BC Canada.

We bring together Pythonistas from academic, web, science, data, visual effects
and other backgrounds under one roof to discuss all things related to Python.

We host meetups every few months. Join us at http://www.meetup.com/vanpyz/ to
be notified of upcoming meetups.
